# Starbucks Promotion Analysis


## Project Organization

The container folder contain files used to run the project inside a Docker container.

Starbucks.ipynb is the notebook used to do the analysis about the data.

test_results.py was provided by Udacity to test the generated model compared with the results generated by Udacity.

training.csv and Test.csv are the datasets used to train and test the machine learning model, respectively.

## Installation

You can rou the project using Docker containers.

There are Dockerfiles inside the container folder.

There are example commands inside notebooks\_container\_start.sh.sample that shows how to run the container.

There is a requiriments.txt file toghether with the Dockerfile, if you want to run the code in a different way.

## Dataset

The training dataset (training.csv) consists of about 85000 rows and 10 columns. There are 7 features used to evaluate the created machine learning model.

The test dataset (Test.csv) contains the same structure of the training dataset, the difference is that the test dataset consists of about 42000 rows.
